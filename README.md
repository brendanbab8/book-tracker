# book-tracker
A java program to track book stats

# Installation/ Execution
Make sure you have the java system requirements for your machine installed.
There is a Makefile for your convenience.
  make default/ make classes: compiles the files
  make clean: removes the compiled .class files
  make run: runs the main method (and thus, the application.) [NOTE: this is yet to be implemented.]
